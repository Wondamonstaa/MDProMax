Hi! 

A) How to run the code: 
    1) Download the provided files, including main.py and mdp_input_book.txt, and locate them in your chosen directory;
    2) Open your computer terminal (Command + space => type 'Terminal'); 
    3) Using 'cd' command, navigate the path to the directory where you located the downloaded files, including: main.py, mdp_input_book.txt. Example: cd /Users/wondamonsta/Desktop/UIC/2023/Fall2023/CS411/Homework6;
    4) Once done, check if the directory was located successfully: type 'pwd' in the terminal to check the path you specified; 
    5) In your terminal, type 'python "main.py" mdp_input_book.txt';
    6) If the provided input files are not damaged, in the terminal you will see the output of the program, consisting of 57 iterations and the final policy and iteration outputs as required;
    7) In the following assignment we were allowed to use any AI tools to complete it: the parts of code where I used such tools are specified in the main.py in the comments right next to the line of code. Additionally, I tried to explained my steps as detailed as possible. If something is missing - forgive me, please. Taking 7 classes this semester D:
