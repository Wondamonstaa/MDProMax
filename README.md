MDProMax: Project Description
---

MDProMax, led by Kiryl Baravikou during the CS 411 course in the Fall of 2023, is a project aimed at mastering Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This project is dedicated to implementing the Value Iteration algorithm, a fundamental technique for deriving optimal policies in MDP scenarios. By leveraging Python, MDProMax provides a user-friendly platform for defining MDPs, specifying states, actions, transition models, rewards, and discount factors, and ultimately computing optimal decision-making policies. Fully written in Python.

MDProMax distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating advanced memoization techniques into its algorithm. The project introduces the MemoMix mixin object, which plays a pivotal role in optimizing computational efficiency. This results in faster and more streamlined computations, setting MDProMax apart as an efficient and effective MDP solver.

Key Features:

1. Implementation of the Value Iteration algorithm for MDPs.
2. Integration of advanced memoization techniques for enhanced performance.
3. Capabilities for parsing input files to define essential MDP parameters.
4. Introduction of the MemoMix mixin object for efficient memoization.
5. User-friendly interface with robust error handling and clear usage instructions.
